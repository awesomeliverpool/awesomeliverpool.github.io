        <p>“Trustees” are what we call the dozen or so people who give £50 a month and help promote Awesome Liverpool to the widest possible audience, so everybody in Liverpool has the opportunity to benefit.</p>

        <p>Even if you can’t give £50 a month, if you think you can help us reach new audiences we’re not currently reaching, or can add a new perspective to our judging panel, then get in touch!</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">What’s the history of Awesome Liverpool?</h2>

        <p>We are the Liverpool chapter of the international <a href="https://www.awesomefoundation.org">Awesome Foundation</a>.</p>

        <p>In 2014, a group of friends in the Liverpool tech sector realised there wasn’t a functioning Awesome chapter in the UK yet, so they set one up. Since then, we’ve been joined by a stunning roster of volunteer trustees, from all sorts of backgrounds, each donating their time, expertise, and usually £50/mth, to help make awesome projects happen in and around Liverpool.</p>

        <p>Anyone in the Liverpool City Region can apply for a £500 gift, and we particularly welcome applications from people who wouldn’t normally apply to the big funding bodies. There’s no limit to the number of times you can apply, and we’ve had a few projects that have won more than once, so that’s fine too.</p>

        <p>The £500 gifts are no strings attached – there’s no reporting or checking up. We trust you to spend the £500 wisely, furthering Awesome in the universe.</p>

        <p>We generally like to see projects that:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Solve a problem</li>
            <li>Have a clear budget</li>
            <li>Benefit the people of Liverpool</li>
            <li>Bring joy to the world</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If you think you have an idea that hits those criteria, <a href="#">read our guidance for top tips on making your application stand out</a>, and then <a href="#">apply online</a>.</p>
